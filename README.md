ARTOPS (http://artops.surge.sh/) is an application designed to connect people looking for custom art with artists in their local area. Users can post a new project that they are looking for and artists can respond if they are interested in providing the work. Each user creates a profile that includes their locaiton, artistic skills, and a link to their personal website to show their work.

This was a Galvanize Q3 Group Project where we created an application in an unfamiliar environment. Our team chose to learn React as a new front-end framework.
